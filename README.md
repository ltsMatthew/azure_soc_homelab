# Building a SOC Homelab with Azure Sentinel

## Introduction

In this guide, I will walk through setting up a SOC (Security Operations Center) homelab using Azure Sentinel for security monitoring. This lab will simulate real-world security analysis, incorporating Sysmon for endpoint logging and Log Analytics for data collection.

## Objectives

*  Deploy a Windows Virtual Machine (VM) on Azure

*  Install and configure Sysmon to collect logs

*  Forward logs to Azure Sentinel

*  Analyze logs using Kusto Query Language (KQL)
